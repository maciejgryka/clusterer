sequential k-means clustering

Small header file implementing multidimensional data clustering using
sequential k-means. See

http://www.cs.princeton.edu/courses/archive/fall08/cos436/Duda/C/sk_means.htm

for explanation.

To test, first run the python script create_data.py. Then run main.cpp (make 
sure the paths to data files are corect). Once it's done (should be quick), run
plot_clusters.py for a 3D visualization of points (white) and cluster centers 
(red spheres).
